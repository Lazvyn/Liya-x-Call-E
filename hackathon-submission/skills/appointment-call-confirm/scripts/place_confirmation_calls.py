place_confirmation_calls.py — appointment-call-confirm skill runner.

Reads a batch of upcoming appointments (CSV or JSON), dry-runs the list
for explicit approval, then places one outbound CALL-E call per
recipient (serially), polls each to a terminal state, and writes a
structured results CSV.

Standalone by design: only depends on `requests` and a CALL-E API key.
No dependency on any particular agent framework, so it can be pointed
at CALL-E's SDK/API/CLI/MCP directly by any host that adopts this
skill.

Safety properties enforced by this script — none of them have an
override flag; there is no escape hatch on any of these (see
references/safety.md for the full contract):
    - Phone numbers are validated as strict ASCII E.164 before anything
      else happens to them — no Unicode digit variants, no smuggled
      characters.
    - An allowlist is REQUIRED for every live (--confirm) run. Only
      recipients whose phone exactly matches an allowlist entry are
      called; everyone else is skipped and reported as failed. A live
      run with no --allowlist given is refused outright.
    - Even with --confirm and a valid allowlist, a real run still
      requires the operator to interactively type CONFIRM before any
      call goes out (--yes exists for non-interactive automation, and
      is loudly logged when used — it does not skip the allowlist
      requirement, only the interactive prompt).
    - The API base URL is hardcoded to CALL-E's official HTTPS origin.
      There is no environment variable or flag that can point it
      anywhere else — the bearer credential is never sent to any other
      host, full stop.
    - Each call's idempotency key is a stable hash of the appointment's
      own fields, not a random value — so re-running the same batch
      after an interruption reuses the same key instead of risking a
      duplicate call to the same recipient.
    - Any ambiguous outcome (poll timeout, or a structured result that
      doesn't match a known status) is an unconditional hard stop for
      the rest of the batch. There is no flag to continue past it.
    - Every piece of provider-supplied text that is ever printed or
      written to the results file — error bodies, notes, requested new
      times — is sanitized first: control characters stripped, likely
      credentials/phone numbers redacted, length capped.

Usage:
    export CALLE_API_KEY=...              # required

    # 1. Always dry-run first — this places NO calls, and does not
    #    require an allowlist (nothing is being dialed yet).
    python place_confirmation_calls.py --in appointments.csv --dry-run

    # 2. A live run REQUIRES --allowlist. There is no way to place a
    #    real call without one. Interactive CONFIRM is still required
    #    even with --confirm passed.
    python place_confirmation_calls.py --in appointments.csv --out results.csv \\
        --confirm --allowlist assets/authorized_numbers.example.txt

appointments.csv columns (header row required):
    recipient_name, phone, appointment_time, context, business_name[, region, locale]

    - phone: strict ASCII E.164, e.g. +14155550101
    - appointment_time: ISO 8601 with timezone, e.g. 2026-09-05T15:00:00-04:00
    - context: one sentence, e.g. "annual checkup with Dr. Rao"
    - business_name: who the call says it's calling on behalf of
    - region / locale: optional; region is inferred from the phone's
      country code when omitted (see references/result-schema.md)
